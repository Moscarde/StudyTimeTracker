# Study Time Tracker 📚⏰

This Python script allows you to track your study time on a daily basis. Creates a text file to store the total time spent studying. You can start and stop the timer to record your study sessions, and the script will calculate and update your daily study time.

## Features 🌟

- Automatically creates a text file for the current day if it doesn't exist.
- Records study time with start and stop functionality.
- Tracks and displays total study time for the day.
- Appends the timestamp and study duration to the log.

## Prerequisites 📋

>- Python 3.x
>- Study sessions

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:
```shell
python study_time_tracker.py
```
4. The script will start a timer. Press Enter to stop the timer when you finish studying.
5. You can start a new timer by pressing [Y] or any other key to stop and exit the program.
5. The recorded study time and timestamp will be saved in a text file named YYYY-MM-DD.txt.

## Example 📊

Here's an example of what the recorded data in the text file may look like:

```text
TOTAL_TIME: 5:45:22
LOG:
Date 01/01/2023, 14:30:15 - Time Spent 2:30:15
Date 01/01/2023, 19:45:22 - Time Spent 3:15:07
```



In this example, two study sessions were recorded on January 01, 2023, with their respective durations.

## Note 📝
>Make sure to stop the timer when you finish your study session to record the time accurately.
>You can run the script multiple times in a day, and it will update the same text file for that specific day.
